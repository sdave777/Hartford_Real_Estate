# Hartford Real Estate

20 fields, describing properties that were sold in a 2 year period, up to October of 2020. The first three ID fields may have to be removed, unless more information can be found (for example, what does the building type ID indicate). The parcel ID and neighborhood ID will be used as identifiers. The square footage and appraisal/sale prices, along with the date, may prove useful.

There are many null values for the "apartment number" and this may also be removed. All other data appears correct and useful.

The data has not been summarized and will require further analysis.


## Avenues of Inquiry

Is it possible to use perform a trend analysis to predict future values, especially since the dataset ends right at the beginning of COVID?

Are the values of certain neighborhoods, square footage values, etc more stable than others?

Are there any properties that were sold multiple times during the 2 year window? Did the values change during this time?

## Value Proposition

There is possible ability to predict stability or value fluctuations with this information. This may be done by individual properties or by neighborhood identifiers. 

Such an analysis may help a stakeholder decide whether they should sell, rent, or purchase any of the properties in the dataset.
